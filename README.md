# DEVELOPER'S NOTES
- This is open source code. I don't mind you modifying it or using it in your own projects. (Hell, the idea behind cosmetics on a server is blatantly unoriginal and isn't anywhere close to being mine.) I *do* mind you claiming it as your own. Now, don't get me wrong, if you've modified it so much that it isn't mine anymore, think  [Trigger's Broom](https://www.google.com/search?q=trigger%27s+broom+paradox&client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=APwXEdc1u_76uVhyauhqF9XRAS44DR-fVQ%3A1684873372396&ei=nCBtZK7gF7ax5NoPrb-nuAE&ved=0ahUKEwiunum2ooz_AhW2GFkFHa3fCRcQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=trigger%27s+broom+paradox&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIICAAQgAQQiwM6CggAEEcQ1gQQsAM6CggAEIoFELADEEM6DQguEIoFENQCELADEEM6BwgAEIoFEEM6BQgAEIAEOgYIABAWEB46CQgAEBYQHhCLA0oECEEYAFCtAli5DGChE2gBcAF4AIABb4gBiAaSAQM1LjOYAQCgAQHIAQq4AQPAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz-serp) type shit, I don't care anymore. 
- If you would like to review this plugin I'd love to see it! I welcome all sharing and distribution of this. Additionally, constructive criticism is what we call *poggers*. Give me your honest opinions.
- There *is* a pride cape included in the resources bundle. I understand that not everyone shares my personal beliefs, and that is completely alright! You have the right to your own, and I respect that. As such, this is disabled by default, but if you want it, you can always set 'enabled' to true in the capes.yml file.

# DISCLAIMER
I'll be real here, my dudes. A lot of this code is sloppy because I gutted it out of my much older projects. I can't be asked to polish it right now. Some of the code in SkinUtils isn't even mine. I tried to credit who I could. 

# EXTRA CAPES/CLOTHES
I sell some cosmetics on my discord, found at .dd/vqnic
